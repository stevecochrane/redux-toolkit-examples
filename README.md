# redux-toolkit-examples

These are the examples I used when working through the [Educative](https://www.educative.io/) course
[Intermediate Redux with Redux Toolkit](https://www.educative.io/courses/intermediate-redux-toolkit), by Ohans
Emmanuel. In short, it shows how to go from regular Redux usage with React to using Redux Toolkit, which removes a lot
of boilerplate to make working with Redux easier.

The first example app, [Cat Mood](https://github.com/stevecochrane/redux-toolkit-examples/tree/main/01-cat-mood), is a
very simple app that has a single state variable, updating it with a Redux Toolkit slice.

The second example app, [TweetFind](https://github.com/stevecochrane/redux-toolkit-examples/tree/main/02-tweetfind),
shows how to fetch data from an API by making asynchronous requests using `createAsyncThunk`.
